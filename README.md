<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Blog sphere is a web application where users can see and read different posts from different spheres of life such as sports, science, politics, business and etc. On the home page, the user sees the featured posts as well as the most recently added posts. Also, the user can choose the category, which is located on the navigation bar. After clicking, to the user will be shown all the posts related to the given category. When the user clicks on a post, the application takes the user to a page where the details for that post are displayed. When clicking on a post, the number of views of the post increases. Next to that post there are suggestions for similar posts. Under each post there are comments as well as the possibility of writing comments for a given post. Every user can subscribe and that way they will get the latest news from this blog. It is important to note that this project consists of two applications (for the admin and for the user). We have described the application for the user, now it is the admin application's turn. Admin application has authorization and authentication. It is not possible to access the application without prior login. Admin can add, change and delete categories, posts and subscribers.
